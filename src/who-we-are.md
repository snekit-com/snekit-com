### Our Values

<div class="values-section">
  <div class="value-item">
    <h3>People-centered Technology</h3>
    <p>We believe technology should serve human needs, not the other way around. We prioritize solutions that enhance how people work while respecting their autonomy and well-being.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="value-item">
    <h3>Mission Alignment</h3>
    <p>We choose to work with organisations making positive social and environmental impact. Your mission becomes our mission.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="value-item">
    <h3>Appropriate Solutions</h3>
    <p>We're not tied to specific products or vendors. We recommend solutions that truly fit your needs, context, and capacityâ€”not what's trendy or generates commission.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="value-item">
    <h3>Knowledge Transfer</h3>
    <p>We aim to build your internal capacity, not ongoing dependency. Success means your team feels empowered to maintain and evolve systems after we're gone.</p>
